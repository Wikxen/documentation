Authentication
==============

Getting an API key
------------------

### Paid Method
Visit the [IP1 SMS Shop](https://shop.ip1sms.com/#!/cart) and add an SMS balance or service of your choice and then proceed to checkout. Create an account at the  under Customer information. When done click ``Pay by Card`` and pay for chosen balance or service. An email has by this point been sent to you with login and API credentials. The ones you're interested in for using the API are Account ID and API Key.

### Free Method
Create a free test-account at:
[app.ip1sms.com](https://app.ip1sms.com/account/signup)

Then log in [here](https://app.ip1sms.com/login/) using the credentials sent to the phone number provided via SMS. Once logged in click on Settings and then SMS Gateway API and you will be presented in the left panel with an account ID. Then navigate to `Settings` and then `SMS Gateway API` to get your API details or visit [this link](https://app.ip1sms.com/settings/#api).


All set!
